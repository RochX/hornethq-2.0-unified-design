# Hornet HQ 2.0 Unified Design
This is the repository for the unified design version of overall project of the Advanced Software Development class at Kalamazoo College, Fall 2023.
This is created by one of the four groups working on different aspects of the project and it encompasses one of the two front-end designs for our project.
The project is to recreate the [Hornet HQ](https://hornethq.kzoo.edu) web application, which is what Kalamazoo College uses for many aspects such as class registration, academic advising, and time entry for student employees.
Hornet HQ as stands has many issues for current students, such as the course catalog being hard to search and navigate through and important information being buried under layers of tabs and buttons.

By redesigning Hornet HQ, we wish to highlight these current issues and provide prototypes on possible solutions.

## Running the project
This is a React project, so having `node.js` installed required.
Then running `npm install` within the project directory will install all dependencies needed.
For now running `npm start` will then start the app locally and open it in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Documentation Created from `npx create-react-app`
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts from React

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
